Description: RemoteControl Client
 RemoteControl is an ssh based solution where there's a server that will accept
 any client trying to connect (if allowed) and will only allow to open
 port forwarding, there's no session access or tty level access.
 Clients can be allowed by different rules: Limited Time annonymous login, rsa 
 registered key.
 This package will install the client side.
